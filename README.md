# BlueBox Application

Game and Movie Rental Service - EFA Solo Red Badge Project

## Getting Started

The BlueBox MVC application will allow the Admin to create a database consisting of a full CRUD for games, movies, customers, and rentals. The Admin can also create and set up 'User' roles. With 'User' role. The Admin can also decide who can view a page and who cannot. Any User can look up the BlueBox database of the games, movies, and the ratings that could with them. The Admin can create a 'User' role and can link that role with an email. The Admin can allow the User to rate a game and/or a movie. They can also edit the rating. They can function on any CRUD except the ratings CRUD. 

### Prerequisites

To authorize the 'Admin' and the 'User' role, you must first register as a new user. After a registration, the user must go to the 'Roles' section under the 'Admin' tab. While under the 'Admin Roles', create the 'Admin' role by clicking on the 'Create Role link.

Next, click the 'Assign Role' link. Then, register your selected email and link it to the 'Admin' role.

You are now have the functionality of the 'Admin' role. Now you hold the keys to the BlueBox Application.
